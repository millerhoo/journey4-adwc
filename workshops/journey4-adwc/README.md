# ADWC Journey: Hands-On Workshop
Oracle offers a set of Big Data Journeys to help users get started using Oracle Cloud services with a purpose. This particular journey is designed to show you techniques you can use to build your own **New Data Lake**.

- Real-time and Batch
- Data Science Friendly
- Scalable
- Agile
- Economical


You will learn how to populate and analyze your data lake from a variety of file and streaming sources. You will learn how to execute real-time and batch processing with Oracle’s managed Hive, Spark, Kafka and Object Storage services in the cloud.

The New Data Lake workshop will use a series of tutorials running in Zeppelin Notebook.  The tutorials will leverage the New York City CitiBike data to illustrate how the New Data Lake can work easily with both batch and real-time data.
